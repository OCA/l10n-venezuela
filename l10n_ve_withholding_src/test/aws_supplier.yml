  In order to test account withholding I create a new supplier invoice
-
  I set the context that will be used for the encoding of all the invoices of this file
-
  !context
    'type': 'in_invoice'
-
  I create a supplier invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier0, view: account.invoice_form }:
    name: '0 yaml test account invoice supplier 0'
    account_id: account.a_recv
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    date_document: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_recv
        name: 'Test product description'
        price_unit: 180.0
        product_id: product.product_product_3
        quantity: 10.0
        uos_id: product.product_uom_unit
    journal_id: account.expenses_journal
    partner_id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_8 
    reference_type: none
    type: 'in_invoice'
-
  I check that Initially supplier invoice state is "Draft"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier0}:
    - state == 'draft'
-
  I check that the supplier invoice is a "Supplier Invoice"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier0, string: This is not a supplier invoice}:
    - type == 'in_invoice'
-
  I change the state of invoice to open by clicking Validate button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account_invoice_supplier0}
-
  I check that the invoice state is now "Open"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier0}:
    - state == 'open'
-
  I create a supplier src withholding without wh lines
-
  !record {model: account.wh.src, id: account_wh_supplier01, view: l10n_ve_withholding_src.view_wh_src_form}: &aws_01
    name: 'wh src yaml test account withholding supplier'
    account_id: account.a_pay
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    journal_id: withholding_scr_purchase_journal
    partner_id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_8 
    type: 'in_invoice'
    number: '1112131415'
-
  I  change the state of src withholding to Confirmed by clicking Confirmed button
-
  !python {model: account.wh.src}: |
    from openerp.osv import osv
    aws_id = ref('account_wh_supplier01')
    aws_brw = self.browse(cr, uid, aws_id)
    try:
      aws_brw.action_confirm()
    except osv.except_osv:
      pass
-
  I check that the src withholding state remains in Draft state
-
  !assert {model: account.wh.src, id: account_wh_supplier01}:
    - state == 'draft'
-
  I create a supplier withholding src with wh lines and properly calculated wh amount
-
  !record {model: account.wh.src, id: account_wh_supplier02, view: l10n_ve_withholding_src.view_wh_src_form}: 
    partner_id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_3 
    number: '1514131211'
    wh_amount: 36.0 
    line_ids:
      - name: 'Test src wh line'
        invoice_id: account_invoice_supplier0
        wh_src_rate: 2.0
    <<: *aws_01

  !workflow {model: account.wh.src, action: wh_src_confirmed, ref: account_wh_supplier02}

  I check that the src withholding state change to Confirmed state
