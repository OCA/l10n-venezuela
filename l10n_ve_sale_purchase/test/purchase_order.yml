  1. Purchase order tests
-
  1.1 I create a purchase order (order)
-
  !record {model: purchase.order, id: purchase_order01}:
    company_id: base.main_company
    date_order: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    warehouse_id: stock.warehouse0
    partner_id: base.res_partner_notsotinysarl0
    pricelist_id: product.list0
    partner_address_id: base.res_partner_address_3
    location_id: stock.stock_location_stock
    invoice_method: 'order'
    order_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_pc3
        product_qty: 3
        product_uom: product.product_uom_unit
        price_unit: 10
        name: PC3
        date_planned: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        concept_id: l10n_ve_withholding_islr.islr_wh_concept_no_apply_withholding
      - product_id: product.product_product_pc2
        product_qty: 5
        product_uom: product.product_uom_unit
        price_unit: 20
        name: PC2
        date_planned: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        concept_id: l10n_ve_withholding_islr.islr_wh_concept_no_apply_withholding
-
  1.2 I check that the purchase order was created and is a draft
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: purchase_order01}:
    - state == 'draft'
-
  1.3 I confirm the purchases
-
  !workflow {model: purchase.order, action: purchase_confirm, ref: purchase_order01}
-
  1.4 I check that the order which was was approved
-
  !assert {model: purchase.order, id: purchase_order01}:
    - state == 'approved'
-
  1.5 Check if a record was created in stock picking
-
  !assert {model: stock.picking, search: "[('purchase_id', '=', 'purchase_order01')]"}:
    - state == 'assigned'
-
  1.6 Check if the stock picking record and purchase order has the same lines
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    po = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order01"))
    pur_line_obj=self.pool.get('purchase.order.line')
    pur_line=pur_line_obj.search(cr, uid, [('order_id', '=', po.name) ])
    assert pur_line, 'Purchase order lines was not created'
    sp_obj=self.pool.get('stock.picking')
    sp = sp_obj.search(cr, uid, [('purchase_id', '=', ref("purchase_order01")) ])
    sm_obj=self.pool.get('stock.move')
    sm = sm_obj.search(cr, uid, [('picking_id', '=', sp[0]) ])
    assert len(sm) == len(pur_line), 'Not the same length'
-
  1.7 Check if an invoice was created
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    po = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order01"))
    assert po.invoice_ids, 'Invoice was not created'
    assert po.invoice_ids[0].state == 'draft', 'Invoice was created, but not properly'
-
  1.8 Execute workflow for opening the invoice
-
  !python {model: purchase.order}: |
    from openerp import netsvc
    po = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order01"))
    wf_service = netsvc.LocalService("workflow")
    wf_service.trg_validate(uid, 'account.invoice',po.invoice_ids[0].id,'invoice_open', cr)
    po = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_order01"))
    assert po.invoice_ids[0].state == 'open', 'Invoice must be in open state'
