  4. Check what happend when creating supplier withholding manually.
-
  4.1 Configuring the enviroment.
-
  I set the context for purchase operations in this file.
-
  !context
    'type': 'in_invoice'
-
  I check that the supplier used for the test is withholding agent.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_1, string: Supplier A is not a withholding agent}:
        - wh_iva_agent
-
  I check that the tax used for the test is a withholding tax.
-
    !assert {model: account.tax, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_purchase1, string: Is not a withholding tax.}:
        - ret
-
  4.2 When the Company is a withholding agent.
-
  I set company as a withholding agent.
-
    !record {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner}:
        wh_iva_agent: True
-
  I check that the company is a withholding agent.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: base.main_partner, string: The Company is not a withholding agent}:
        - wh_iva_agent
-
  I create an invoice to be used in the withholding doc.
-
    !record {model: account.invoice, id: wh_manual_purchase_awi_invoice}: &manual_purchase_awi_invoice
        nro_ctrl: AWI MANUAL PURCHASE INVOICE (WH COMPANY)
        supplier_invoice_number: AWI MANUAL PURCHASE INVOICE (WH COMPANY)
        partner_id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_1
        date_invoice: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        company_id: base.main_company
        account_id: account.a_sale
        currency_id: base.EUR
        reference_type: none
        invoice_line:

            invoice_line_tax_id: &wh_tax
            - l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_purchase1
-
  I check that the invoice is of purchase type (in_invoice).
-
    !assert {model: account.invoice, id: wh_manual_purchase_awi_invoice, string: The invoice is not an in_invoice}:
        - type == 'in_invoice'
-
  I check that the invoice is in draft state.
-
    !assert {model: account.invoice, id: wh_manual_purchase_awi_invoice, string: The invoice is not an out_invoice}:
        - state == 'draft'
-
  I change invoice to open state.
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: wh_manual_purchase_awi_invoice}
-
  I validate if the invoice is in open state.
-
    !assert {model: account.invoice, id: wh_manual_purchase_awi_invoice, string: Invoice is not in Open state}:
        - state == 'open'
-
  I check that the withholding document was created.
-
    !python {model: account.invoice}: |
        inv = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('wh_manual_purchase_awi_invoice'))
        assert inv.wh_iva_id, 'Withholding document was not created'
-
  I cancel the automatic created withholding document.
-
    !python {model: account.invoice}: |
        import netsvc
        from openerp.osv import osv
        inv_brw = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('wh_manual_purchase_awi_invoice'))
        awi_id = inv_brw.wh_iva_id.id
        wf_service = netsvc.LocalService("workflow")
        wf_service.trg_validate(uid, 'account.wh.iva', awi_id, 'cancel', cr)
        awi_obj = self.pool.get('account.wh.iva')
        awi_brw = awi_obj.browse(cr, uid, awi_id)
        assert awi_brw.state == 'cancel', 'It does not change the withholding state to cancel'
-
  I check that the invoice stay (or change if it's needed) in open state.
-
    !assert {model: account.invoice, id: wh_manual_purchase_awi_invoice, string: The invoice is not in open state}:
        - state == 'open'
-
  I create a supplier withholding document manually.
