  1. Testing the supplier withholding automatic created by a supplier invoice confirmation.
-
  1.1 I configure and set the file enviroment.
-
  I set the context for the purchase operations at this file.
-
  !context
    'type': 'in_invoice'
-
  I check that Supplier A is a withholding agent.
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_1, string: Supplier A is not a withholding agent}:
        - wh_iva_agent
-
  I check that Supplier B is not withholding agent
-
    !assert {model: res.partner, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.f_req_partner_7, string: Supplier B is a withholding agent}:
        - wh_iva_agent == False
-
  I check that Tax A is a withholding tax.
-
    !assert {model: account.tax, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_purchase1, string: The tax is not withholdeable}:
        - ret
-
  I check that Tax B is not a withholding tax.
-
    !assert {model: account.tax, id: l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_purchase3, string: The tax is withholdeable}:
        - ret == False
-
  I check if the account is of type payable.
-
    !assert {model: account.account, id: account.a_pay, string: The account is not of receivable type}:
        - type == 'payable'
-
  1.2 Check that the withholding lines generated correspond only to a withholdeable taxes in the invoice.
-
  I create an invoice with one withholdeable tax and one not.
-
    !record {model: account.invoice, id: purchase_invoice_ret_tax, view: account.invoice_supplier_form}:
        nro_ctrl: IVA RET AND NOT RET TAXES

            invoice_line_tax_id:
            - l10n_ve_fiscal_requirements.iva_purchase3
-
  I check if the invoice is in Draft state.
-
    !assert {model: account.invoice, id: purchase_invoice_ret_tax, string: Invoice is not in Open state}:
        - state == 'draft'
-
  I change invoice to Open state.
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: purchase_invoice_ret_tax}
-
  I validate if the invoice is in Open state.
-
    !assert {model: account.invoice, id: purchase_invoice_ret_tax, string: Invoice is not in Open state}:
        - state == 'open'
-
  I check that withholding document was created.
-
    !python {model: account.invoice}: |
        inv = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_invoice_ret_tax"))
        assert inv.wh_iva_id, 'The withholding document was not created'
-
  I check that only the withholdeable tax were added into the withholding document.
-
    !python {model: account.invoice}: |
        inv = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("purchase_invoice_ret_tax"))
        awi_id = inv.wh_iva_id
        for awil_brw in inv.wh_iva_id.wh_lines:
            for awilt_brw in awil_brw.tax_line:
                assert awilt_brw.tax_id.ret, 'This withholding document have withholdig lines of non-ret taxes.'
